# 🔬 AI Skin Disease Detection System

An AI-powered skin disease detection system that analyzes skin lesion images and classifies them into 8 categories. Features an interactive chatbot assistant to explain results, treatments, and causes.

## 📁 Model Files

**Important:** The trained model files are too large (>100MB) for GitHub, so they are hosted on Google Drive:

**📥 Download Models:** [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lAyxcm0465c5LmyNsOG6i96aUx2LbkaZ?usp=sharing)

Please download the model files and place them in the `models/final_model_optimized/` folder before running the application.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Run the application locally using the instructions below.

## �️ Local Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pranay-Suthar/Skin-disease-analysis-using-Deep-Learning.git
cd Skin-disease-analysis-using-Deep-Learning
```

### 2. Download Model Files

Download the trained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lAyxcm0465c5LmyNsOG6i96aUx2LbkaZ?usp=sharing) and extract to:
```
models/final_model_optimized/
├── config.json
├── model.safetensors
└── preprocessor_config.json
```

### 3. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
# For running the app
pip install -r requirements-streamlit.txt

# For full development (includes training dependencies)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up Environment (Optional - for chatbot)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GROQ_API_KEY
```

### 6. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run skin_app.py
```

Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

## 🖥️ Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Click "Browse files" and select a skin lesion image (JPG, PNG)
2. **Analyze**: Click "🚀 Analyze Image" to get AI prediction
3. **View Results**: See the predicted condition, confidence score, and severity
4. **Chat**: Ask the AI assistant questions about your results
5. **Learn More**: Check the resources section for treatments and articles
6. **Download Report**: Save your analysis as a text file

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **ML Model**: Custom trained Swin Transformer (offline)
- **Inference**: PyTorch + Transformers
- **Chatbot**: Groq API with LLaMA 3.1
- **Dataset**: ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration)

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Validation Accuracy | 85-92% |
| Top-3 Accuracy | 96-98% |

## 🔄 Using Your Own Model

If you have trained your own skin disease classification model, you can easily integrate it:

### Option 1: Replace Existing Model
1. Place your model files in `models/final_model_optimized/`
2. Ensure files are named: `config.json`, `model.safetensors`, `preprocessor_config.json`
3. Update the `LABEL_MAP` in `skin_app.py` if your classes are different

### Option 2: Add New Model Path
1. Update `LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` in `skin_app.py`:
   ```python
   LOCAL_MODEL_PATH = "models/your_model_folder"
   ```
2. Place your model files in the new folder
3. Restart the application

### Supported Model Formats
- HuggingFace Transformers format (recommended)
- PyTorch models with AutoImageProcessor
- Models with 8-class skin disease classification
